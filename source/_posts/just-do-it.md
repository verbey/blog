One thing that I noticed about people that excel in some field is that they use the time when they're bored to do something related to the said field.

When they have free time instead of lying around being bored, browsing social media feed they would solve Math problems, program, do language exercises etc.

They are good at something because they do it. They do it because they like it. That's why they do it *regulary*. 

This part is often overlooked. People want to excel at something overnight, except it never works like that. You can't get big muscles unless you exercise regulary, you can't get a Ph D for reading about a subject for a whole day non-stop.

It is all a matter of dedication over a long period of time. Even if you don't like doing it, you will finish it faster and better through doing smaller bits.

That thing that you want to do but keep reappointing to a latter date, do you *really* think you can get grasp of it without starting now?

You can do it and you know it, but you procrastinate because you don't know what to do, until the moment comes and you feel brave enough to wander into the field for an extended period of time without having the slightest idea of what you are doing.

As always, quantity forms quality, so to "conquer" the quality of something hard and unknown you have to divide-and-conquer your way, which best works when doing it on set intervals of time.

Stop the procrastionation. I believe in you.
