# Pre-amble

I have already mentioned in the introduction post that I follow [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) to study web development. As of now, I am at 92% of the JavaScript course of the **Full Stack Javascript** path. 

Note: after finishing the foundations course I decided to go full stack JS, because I was already familiar with Node.js. For this reason I can't exactly judge the Ruby on Rails course but I suspect the strong points of the path I chose could be applied to the Ruby on Rails one.

Yep, I didn't finish the curriculum yet, you read that right. Nevertheless, I think I am at point where I could provide some *food for thought* for those thinking if starting TOP is worth it and maybe deciding between courses/platforms/guides/books to study web development.

*Again, this is very important: the post below is not a review of the course as a whole but rather a collection of my thoughts about TOP so far.*

# Material
## General

The Odin Project does not throw you right into programming in the way most other free resources do, but rather introduce you to some basic concepts that exist in the field. Entry-level material is provided, they make you form your dev environment gradually, never introduce too much concepts as once etc.

You will never be taught a concept without being provided with ideas how to practice it: from a full-blown project to smaller exercises. You are *actively* discouraged from skipping practice.

There is a lesson at the beginning talking about motivation and [mindset](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-motivation-and-mindset). This lesson manages to explain things very coherently, in a way newcomers *need* to hear, and after finishing it you will be set for studying.

## Vanilla first

TOP is trying not to throw people into frameworks right away, which I see as a very good thing because modern CSS and JS are very powerful and are catching up to their post processors and frameworks.

By learning vanilla first, a student gets a strong foundation of technology they will use in their job instead of relying wholely on some third-party technology that could pull the rug anytime or become unmaintained.

This is also good news for the web as a whole, because it teaches people that building simple websites with no 10000 bloated libraries is possible and could even be much faster.

## Additional resources

The course gives you articles and videos as additional resources that are really good and are not actually *required* to grasp the concept you have been introduced to. So, if you are in a rush, you can skip it completely without losing anything that is important for the basics. 

Though, if you do check it the additional resource, you would understand the concept better or learn some obscure thing that might help you with some non-standard situation or get information on how to avoid it completely.

Sometimes the additional resources section could feel mundane and because the resources provided might only be a rephrasal of what was already said in the assignment section, but this is not the end of the world and is only true for some rare cases.

# Dev environment

## Git

The course makes you use the [git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system *early on*, which is I think is super important. It's the small details of TOP that make it so good. You are introduced to git from very early on, which will help you later so much when you will need more advanced features, because by the time you will comfortable with the basics.

Can we talk about modern day coding without git? No. Working on a bigger project without using git is like going for a long ride on a car without bringing a navigator or at the very least a paper map. You can do it, but *why would you*?

## GNU/Linux

A very important part of the Odin project is that they force you to use GNU/Linux for your development work. A UNIX-like system will make your life much easier and won't introduce any issues because you are studying web development and browsers, surprise, are identical across operating systems.

Staying on Windows will cause you a lot of time fighting the OS to get something to work, like Node.js, which could be done with a simple command shell script in a minute on a Unix-like system.

People are used to "Windows" often meaning "easier" and instinctively would want to stay there but in our particular case, switching to a UNIX-like system would actually *save* time.

# Other

## Feedback

I loved getting help in the community. You see, you are actually encouraged to do the assignment yourself as much as you can, so even when you do ask for help, you will be *directed* towards the solution but it won't be revealed to you. This way, you still develop the thought process that should go in your brain when you solve a problem yourself, but you achieve it faster.

**Feedback** on projects and getting helps when you're stuck at some part **is a strong side of TOP**. You can share your projects with the community. It is also possible to share your projects through the website, where solutions are displayed based on the amount of stars each projects receives.

## Project submissions

**Except when it isn't**. You see, TOP is volunteer-driven so there is a big chance your project would sink among countless others. On the project solutions section of the website, usually the ones with *appealing design* get to the top, even if they lack some features or use bad coding practices. I think it would be great if the maintainers chose some reference solutions, so if someone decided to peek at the solution, they would at the very least see a good one that might make them learn a thing or two.

Also, it would have been nice if TOP pushed newer solutions for others to see, so it's not impossible to get noticed just because you were late to the party.

## Discord

Their community is hosted on Discord. It is a reasonable solution considering TOP is free but now that they have started accepting donations, I *really* hope some of that would go to host a proper forum using software such as Disqus. Discord can be great for getting quick help and general discussion but is not very suitable for making announcements and sharing help.

# Conclusion

It should be noted though that any negative points are fixable because the Odin project is open source so you could contribute to it if you think some parts of it need redaction. The project is in the constant state of improving and updating its resources, which is something that is harder to achieve with books.

The Odin Project is one of the cases where free is better than a lot of paid alternatives, and if you are not sure where to start your career in webdev, I suggest you go with TOP. It may have some problems here and there but they are insignificant and can be completely dismissed when we consider the free nature of the project. The self-paced learning, diversive types of study material, the coherent structure and practice-oriented studying helped me get out of [tutorial hell](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qrlx5m/what_exactly_is_tutorial_hell/) and I plan to donate to the maintainers after I land my first job in web development. 

Happy coding!
