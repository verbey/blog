# Introduce yourself
I'm a self-taught web developer from Eastern Europe organising a little corner for my thoughts on the Internet. My interests are:

- Software engineering (Web development in particular). I am currently following the Odin Project, which is focused on Full Stack development, but I plan to move to Back end in the future. My language of choice is JavaScript (Sorry, "Anything other than C is bloat" folks). I chose it because it's simple, has good looking syntax and is very popular. I also know basics of C/C++. 

- GNU/Linux. Messing around with my system, feels super fun and helps expand my knowledge of how OSes work.

- Geeky stuff: anime, tv series, films, videogames. I think I could write reviews for any of these but don't expect too much (×﹏×)

 # Why?
I love longreads and I always wanted to be able to impress others with my writing as much as some of longreads I read impressed me. I learned not so long ago about the Indie Web and thought giving my own blog a try would be a great idea.

# So you're yet another generic nerd like 98% of the other people on the Indie Web?

Yes :)

# Are you going to be writing the same stuff those nerds do?

No. I want to write original content, being a reader of a lot of blogs, I, myself, am tired of constant whining about social media and explanations why should *you* write and/or move to Indie Web.

# Why does it feel like a lot of stuff is missing?

I am still figuring stuff out so the blog page may seem incomplete. Because it is. As of right now, I didn't even get my hands out ot figuring out how to access RSS of my blog.

# What powers the blog?
The website is generated from Markdown text files using **Hugo** with **Blowfish** theme. It is hosted for free at **Github Pages**.

# Why Github Pages rather than Neocities or GitLab Pages or Codeberg Pages?

Because Github is owned by Microsoft and lets me host my blog for free. Putting load on a corporate server feels good.

# Anything else you've got to say? 

Thank you for finding this blog and reading up to this moment. Stay safe
