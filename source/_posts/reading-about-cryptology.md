Greetings, my dear and most beloved reader! 

Around a year ago I bought myself a book about cybersecurity. Being a privacybro in the past, I, naturally, wondered how all those fancy encryption algorithms work. That's why when I learned my uni library has a book on the topic I thought to give reading it a try.

Today ("Today" stands for "a month ago", it took me a long time to actually setup my blog and publish this) I am pleased to announce to the world that I have finished reading Chapter 2 of it, named "Mathematical foundations of Cryptology". I don't want to lie to you, it was a hard, slow read and I didn't really grasp *all* concepts presented in it but now I know what is the logic behind some of the tools I use daily and feel slightly smarter.

Behind most of cryptology are one-way functions, ones that are easy to compute if you know all parameters but make it hard to "decompute" passed values from the result. Isn't it impressive how something like discrete logarithm can help you secure communication against another human? Under things that I once categorised as those that border magic lie such simple down-to-Earth concepts. Quality comes from quantity, as Hegel put it over a hundred years ago, and so complexities come from certain amount of simplicities. 

If you're interested in how things work but don't want to go into a huge amount of rabbit holes, then consider reading [this article](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/cryptology), which, in my humble opinion, does a good job explaining things to people who don't have the time or desire to learn about cryptology in detail and dive deeper into the topic.

I really want to try implementing the algorithms presented in the book but I also want and have to do a lot of other things, so this is, sadly, not my number 1 priority. Makes me wish there were more than 24 hours in a day so I could pick more past times and hobbies like that.
